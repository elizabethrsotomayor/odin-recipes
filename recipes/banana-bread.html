    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2&frac14; cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
      <li>&frac12; tsp salt</li>
      <li>3 very ripe bananas</li>
      <li>&frac12; cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>&frac13; cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F (180&deg;C)</li>
      <li>
        Butter a 9x5 inch loaf pan, then dust with flour, tapping out the
        excess.
      </li>
      <li>In a bowl, stir together flour, sugar, baking soda and salt.</li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mash the bananas with a fork. Add the melted butter,
        eggs, yogurt and vanilla and stir until blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the flour mixture gradually to the bowl with the banana mixture,
        stirring gently until just combined. Stir in half the walnuts, if using.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the remaining walnuts
        on top, if using.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out
        clean, about 1 hour. If the top begins to brown too much, cover the loaf
        loosely with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let cool for 10 minutes, then turn the loaf out and let cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>Cut loaf into slices and serve.</li>
    </ol>
